## Rear Motors
Ensure the rear motors are connected to their motor controller with opposite
polarity (i.e., ensure the black lead of one motor is connected to the red lead
of the other), and connect the joined leads to the output of the motor
controller. The polarity (if wrong) will be corrected in a later step. One way
to do this neatly is to have a splitter after the motor controller (input on
the bottom, output on the right):
